                        Chadwick Boseman plays Jackie Robinson in his early life playing in the negro league. Jackie Robinson then gets an oppurtunity to play in the majors for the Brooklyn Dodgers. This film covers a historical story about the first African American to play in the MLB. One of the first movies i saw Chadwick Boseman act and i felt like he really embodied the character. His stern looks into camera and body type really helped him become Jackie Robinson.

                    <p>
                        Boseman plays T'challa the king of Wakanda a fictional place in Africa. Wakanda is hidden in the forest and has technology more advanced than any where in the world. The film follows T'challa as he takes the throne after his father death and is challeneged by his long lost cousin who believs Wakanda should use thier advanced weapons to lead a revolution of African Americans. This is one of my favorite movies in the Marvel Cinematic Universe because of the soudtrack and CGI. Chadwick Bosmans acting in this film and commitment to the charcater goes above and beyond.

                    <p>
                        Chadwick Boseman plays a police officer for the NYPD who is a detective trying to uncoverr the truth as to who killed 5 police officers.Two men try to complete a robbery of cocaine from a storage house. Both men get into a shootout with NYPD, they escape on foot and are trying to make it ouut the city. As Boseman continues his investigation he begins to wonder who the real criminals and requests all 21 bridges in or out of NY city be closed off. He later uncovers a sinister secret inside the NYPD. This action thriller shows Boseman in a different light, he plays a serious no nonsense detective who feels like the NYPD is against him. In this film he shows how he mastered the fighting choreography needed to perform and his tone of voice and emotion make you belive he is that detective.
